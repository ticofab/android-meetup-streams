Android Meetup Stream
=====================

Example app that listen asynchronously to an endless stream of events.
The endpoint I used is the open [Meetup RSPV API v2](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/2/rsvps/).

This example combines:

* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for stream manipulation
* [Retrofit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36603368/android-retrofit-2-rxjava-listen-to-endless-stream) for the API interface
* [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) for views injection
